This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

#make plot of gdp (x) vs lifeExp (y)
gapmider_1997%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy", title = "GDP versus Life Expectancy") +
