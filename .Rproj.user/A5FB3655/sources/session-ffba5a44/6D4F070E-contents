This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.
```{r read-data, include=FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```

```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}

#make plot of gdp (x) vs lifeExp (y)
gapminder_1997%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy", title = "GDP versus Life Expectancy") +
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```
```{r basic c-country-stats}
n_Countries <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  select(country)%>%
  n_distinct()

#min GDP
minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarise(round(min(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()

maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarise(round(max(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()
```
The above plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy
for a total of `r n_Countries ` countries. For this set of countries,
economic wealth ranged from a minimum of USD `r minGDP`
to a maximum of USD `r maxGDP` per capita.
